import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

[As explained in the introduction](/docs#write-side-read-side), OramaCore is split in two sides: the **reader side** and the **writer side**.

Therefore, depending on the operation you want to perform, you will need to use different API keys.

In total, OramaCore will give you access to three different kinds API keys:

## Master API Key

<Callout type='warn'>
**Not safe to share**. Never share the master API key publicly. Treat it as a password.
</Callout>

The **master API key** is an essential key that allows you to configure the OramaCore instance and create or delete new collections.

It's configurable via the [`config.yaml`](/docs/configuration) file under the `writer_side` section:

```yaml
# ...
writer_side:
    master_api_key: foobar
# ...
```

You will need this API key to:

- Create a new collection
- Delete a collection
- Update the configuration of a collection

In all the cases above, you will need to pass the master API key in the `Authorization` header of the request as a `Bearer` token.

Example:

<Tabs groupId='create' persist items={['cURL']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <master-api-key>' \
  -d '{ 
    "id": "products",
    "read_api_key": "my-read-api-key",
    "write_api_key": "my-write-api-key"
  }'
```
</Tabs>

As you can see, when creating a new collection, you will need to create the `read_api_key` and `write_api_key` as well. You will them use them to perform read and write operations on the collection.

## Write API Key

<Callout type='warn'>
**Not safe to share**. Never share the write API key publicly. Treat it as a password.
</Callout>

The **write API key** is used to insert, update, or delete documents in a collection, as well as creating new [hooks](/docs/javascript-hooks/introduction) and [actions](/docs/party-planner#writing-custom-actions).

Every collection has its own write API key, which is generated when you create the collection.

You will need this API key to:

- Insert one or more documents into a collection
- Update one or more documents in a collection
- Delete one or more documents from a collection
- Create a new hook or action

In all the cases above, you will need to pass the write API key in the `Authorization` header of the request as a `Bearer` token.

Example:

<Tabs groupId='insert' persist items={['cURL']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X PATCH \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/documents \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <write-api-key>' \
  -d '[
    {
      "title": "My first document",
      "content": "This is the content of my first document."
    }
  ]'
```
</Tabs>

## Read API Key

<Callout type='info'>
**Safe to share**. This API key performs read operations only. You can share it publicly.
</Callout>

The **read API key** is used to perform read operations on a collection.

Every collection has its own read API key, which is generated when you create the collection.

You will need this API key to:

- Perform full-text, hybrid, or vector search
- Read the documents in a collection
- Perform answer sessions

In all the cases above, you will need to pass the read API key as a query parameter in the request.

Example:

<Tabs groupId='search' persist items={['cURL']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v0/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/search?api-key=<read-api-key> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "term": "How to insert documents in OramaCore?" }'
```
</Tabs>
