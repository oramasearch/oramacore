Orama ❤️ JavaScript. Since day zero, we've been working on JavaScript solutions and we're excited to bring this love to OramaCore.

We believe that JavaScript is the _**lingua franca**_ of the web, and we want to make it easy for developers to use JavaScript to customize OramaCore.

## What are JavaScript Hooks?

JavaScript hooks are a way to customize OramaCore using JavaScript. You can use JavaScript hooks to:

- Customize text extraction and transformation
- Implement custom business logic
- Integrate with third-party services
- Write your own agents and actions
- And much more!

At the time of writing, we're working on a set of JavaScript hooks that you can use to customize OramaCore. We're planning to release the first version of JavaScript hooks in **v1.0.0**.

## Creating a Hooks

Once you have created a collection, you can create a JavaScript hook by sending a POST request to the `/v0/hooks` endpoint.

Here's an example of how to create a JavaScript hook:

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/{COLLECTION_ID}/v0/hooks/add \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization Bearer <write-api-key>' \
  -d '{
    "id": "selectEmbeddingProperties",
    "code": "function selectEmbeddingProperties(document) { return document.title; }"
  }'
```

Before inserting the hook, OramaCore will validate the JavaScript code to ensure it's safe to run. If the code is invalid, OramaCore will return an error.

## Available Hooks

Right now, OramaCore supports only one JavaScript hook (with the plan of adding dozens in the near future).

The hook is called [`selectEmbeddingProperties`](/docs/javascript-hooks/selectEmbeddingProperties) and allows you to customize the text extraction and transformation process for each document.
