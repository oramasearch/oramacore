<Callout type='warn'>
At the time of writing, the OramaCore APIs are in beta. We can guarantee that the APIs **will change** in a way that breaks existing applications.

We will make these APIs stable in the v1.0.0 release, planned for February 28th, 2025.
</Callout>

With OramaCore we aim to provide a set of APIs that are backward compatible - or at least, as similar as possible - to those exposed by [Orama Cloud](https://docs.orama.com/cloud/performing-search).

At the time of writing, with OramaCore being in beta, we are still working on the APIs and SDKs. We are also working on the documentation, so please bear with us.

## APIs & SDKs

We will provide both REST APIs and SDKs for OramaCore.

We will always recommend to use the SDKs, as they will provide a more idiomatic way to interact with OramaCore.

Also, they'll abstract away a lot of the complexity that comes with server-side events, retries, and other things that are not directly related to the business logic of your application.

However, we understand that sometimes you might want to use the REST APIs directly, and we will provide them for you.

## SDKs

At the time of writing, the official SDKs are not yet available. We are working on them, and we will release them as soon as possible.

We plan to provide SDKs for the following languages:

- JavaScript
- Python
- Swift
- Kotlin

### JavaScript SDK

The JavaScript SDK will be available as an NPM package. You will be able to install it with:

```bash
npm install @orama/core
```

Once installed, you can link it to your project with:

```javascript
import { OramaCore } from '@orama/core';

const orama = new OramaCore({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  apiKey: '<api-key>'
})
```

And you're ready to go.
