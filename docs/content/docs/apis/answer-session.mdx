## APIs

<Callout>
API Key type: **`read_api_key`**. Safe to expose to the public.
</Callout>

OramaCore is an answer engine. You can ask questions about any document in your collection, and OramaCore will return the most relevant documents that answer your question.

OramaCore can also come up with a plan to answer your question, by executing a series of steps that will lead to the most correct answer.

At the time of writing, OramaCore supports answer sessions through the SDKs only.

### Creating an Answer Session

To create an answer session, you can use the following API:

<Tabs groupId='answer-session' persist items={['JavaScript']}>
```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>',
  readAPI: '<read_api_key>',
})

const answerSession = collection.createAnswerSession()
```
</Tabs>

You can optionally pass a configuration object to the `createAnswerSession` method. The configuration object can contain the following fields:

<Tabs groupId='answer-session-options' persist items={['JavaScript']}>
```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>',
  readAPI: '<read_api_key>',
})

const answerSession = collection.createAnswerSession({
    initialMessages: [
        { role: 'user', content: 'How do I install OramaCore?' },
        { role: 'assistant', content: 'You can install OramaCore by pulling the oramasearch/oramacore:latest Docker image' }
    ],
    events: {
        onStateChange(state) {
            console.log('State changed:', state)
        }
    }
})
```
</Tabs>

The `initialMessages` field is an array of messages that will be sent to the answer session as soon as it is created. This is useful if you are resuming a conversation, or if you want to provide some context to the answer session.

The `events` field is an object that can contain the following event handlers:

- `onStateChange(state)`: Called whenever the state of the answer session changes. The `state` object contains the current state of the answer session.
- More events to be added soon.

The `onStateChange` is especially important, and we will provide more information in the next section.

### The `onStateChange` Event

The `onStateChange` event is called whenever the state of the answer session changes. The `state` object contains the current state of the answer session.

The state is an array of **interactions**, where each interaction looks like this:

```typescript
type PlanAction = {
  step: string
  description: string
}

type Interaction<D = AnyObject> = {
  id: string
  query: string
  response: string
  sources: Nullable<D>
  loading: boolean
  planned: boolean
  plan: Nullable<PlanAction[]>
  aborted: boolean
  error: boolean
  errorMessage: Nullable<string>
}
```

Let's see what each field means:

| Field | Description | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | The CUID of the interaction. | `string` | `bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7` |
| `query` | The query that was sent to OramaCore. | `string` | `How do I install OramaCore?` |
| `response` | The response from OramaCore. | `string` | `You can install OramaCore by pulling the oramasearch/oramacore:latest Docker image` |
| `sources` | The sources that were used to generate the response. | `object` | `[ { id: '123', score: 0.8, document: { ... } } ]` |
| `loading` | Whether the interaction is loading. | `boolean` | `false` |
| `planned` | Whether the interaction was planned. | `boolean` | `false` |
| `plan` | The plan of actions that OramaCore will take to answer the question. Generated by [Party Planner](/docs/architecture/party-planner). | `object` | `[ { step: 'OPTIMIZE_QUERY', description: 'Write an optimized OramaCore query for the user input' } ]` |
| `error` | Whether the interaction has an error. | `boolean` | `false` |
| `errorMessage` | The error message, if any. | `string` | `The document could not be found` |
| `aborted` | Whether the interaction was aborted. | `boolean` | `false` |

Every single time that any of the fields in the interaction changes, the `onStateChange` event will be called with the new state.

This will allow you to build a real-time chat interface, where you can show the user's messages, the assistant's responses, and the plan of actions that OramaCore will take to answer the question.

We'll see some examples in the next sections.

### Performing an Answer Session

Once you have created an answer session, you can start sending messages to it using either the `getPlannedAnswer` or the `getPlannedAnswerStream` methods.

As the name suggests, the `getPlannedAnswer` method will return a single `string` containing the answer to your question. The `getPlannedAnswerStream` method will return a `stream` of messages, allowing you to build a real-time chat interface.

Let's see how they work.

`getPlannedAnswer`:

<Tabs groupId='answer-session-perform' persist items={['JavaScript']}>
```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>',
  readAPI: '<read_api_key>',
})

const answerSession = collection.createAnswerSession()

// Get a single planned answer
const answer = await answerSession.getPlannedAnswer('How do I install OramaCore?')

console.log(answer)
// Output: You can install OramaCore by pulling the oramasearch/oramacore:latest Docker image
```
</Tabs>

`getPlannedAnswerStream`:

<Tabs groupId='answer-session-perform' persist items={['JavaScript']}>
```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>',
  readAPI: '<read_api_key>',
})

const answerSession = collection.createAnswerSession()

// Get a single planned answer
const answer = await answerSession.getPlannedAnswerStream('How do I install OramaCore?')

for await (const message of answer) {
  console.log(message)
}

// Output:
// You can
// install Orama
// Core by
// pulling the oramasearch/
// oramacore:latest Docker
// image
```
</Tabs>

### Getting all conversation messages

When performing an answer session, you can retrieve all the messages exchanged by accessing the `messages` field in the `answerSession` object:

<Tabs groupId='answer-session-perform' persist items={['JavaScript']}>
```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>',
  readAPI: '<read_api_key>',
})

const answerSession = collection.createAnswerSession()

const answer = await answerSession.getPlannedAnswer('How do I install OramaCore?')

const allMessages = answerSession.messages

console.log(allMessages)
// Output:
// [ 
//   { role: 'user', content: 'How do I install OramaCore?' },
//   { role: 'assistant', content: 'You can install OramaCore by pulling the oramasearch/oramacore:latest Docker image' }
// ]
```
</Tabs>

### Listening to state changes

As mentioned before, you can listen to state changes in the answer session by passing an `events` object to the `createAnswerSession` method.

The `onStateChange` event will be called every time the state of the answer session changes. This will allow you to build a real-time chat interface, where you can show the user's messages, the assistant's responses, and the plan of actions that OramaCore will take to answer the question.

Let's see an example:

<Tabs groupId='answer-session-perform' persist items={['JavaScript']}>
```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>',
  readAPI: '<read_api_key>',
})

const answerSession = collection.createAnswerSession({
    events: {
        onStateChange(state) {
            console.log(state)
        }
    }
})

const answer = await answerSession.getPlannedAnswer('How do I install OramaCore?')
```
</Tabs>

In the example above, the console will log the following events:

1. First state change: a new interaction in the state. OramaCore generates an unique interaction ID and adds the user query to it.
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7",
            "query": "How do I install OramaCore?",
            "response": "", // The response will be empty until OramaCore generates it
            "sources": null, // The sources will be null until OramaCore generates them
            "loading": true, // The loading flag will be true until the full response is generated
            "planned": true, // 'planned' is set to true since we're using getPlannedAnswer
            "plan": null, // The plan will be null until OramaCore generates it
            "aborted": false,
            "error": false,
            "errorMessage": null
        }
    ]
    ```
2. Second state change: OramaCore comes up with a plan to answer the question. The plan is added to the current interaction. The plan is generated by [Party Planner](/docs/architecture/party-planner).
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7",
            "query": "How do I install OramaCore?",
            "response": "", // The response will be empty until OramaCore generates it
            "sources": null, // The sources will be null until OramaCore generates them
            "loading": true, // The loading flag will be true until the full response is generated
            "planned": true, // 'planned' is set to true since we're using getPlannedAnswer
            "plan": [
                { "step": "OPTIMIZE_QUERY", "description": "Write an optimized OramaCore query for the user input" },
                { "step": "PERFORM_ORAMA_SEARCH", "description": "Perform search using the optimized query generated in the previous step" },
                { "step": "GIVE_REPLY", "description": "Reply with your findings on how to install OramaCore" },
                
            ],
            "aborted": false,
            "error": false,
            "errorMessage": null
        }
    ]
    ```

3. Third state change: OramaCore generates the sources and adds them to the interaction.
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7",
            "query": "How do I install OramaCore?",
            "response": "", // The response will be empty until OramaCore generates it
            "sources": [
                { "id": "123", "score": 0.8, "document": { ... } },
                { "id": "456", "score": 0.6, "document": { ... } }
            ],
            "loading": true, // The loading flag will be true until the full response is generated
            "planned": true, // 'planned' is set to true since we're using getPlannedAnswer
            "plan": [
                { "step": "OPTIMIZE_QUERY", "description": "Write an optimized OramaCore query for the user input" },
                { "step": "PERFORM_ORAMA_SEARCH", "description": "Perform search using the optimized query generated in the previous step" },
                { "step": "GIVE_REPLY", "description": "Reply with your findings on how to install OramaCore" },
                
            ],
            "aborted": false,
            "error": false,
            "errorMessage": null
        }
    ]
    ```

4. Fourth state chage: Orama generates the first response token:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7",
            "query": "How do I install OramaCore?",
            "response": "You can ", // <---- This is the first response token
            "sources": [
                { "id": "123", "score": 0.8, "document": { ... } },
                { "id": "456", "score": 0.6, "document": { ... } }
            ],
            "loading": true, // The loading flag will be true until the full response is generated
            "planned": true, // 'planned' is set to true since we're using getPlannedAnswer
            "plan": [
                { "step": "OPTIMIZE_QUERY", "description": "Write an optimized OramaCore query for the user input" },
                { "step": "PERFORM_ORAMA_SEARCH", "description": "Perform search using the optimized query generated in the previous step" },
                { "step": "GIVE_REPLY", "description": "Reply with your findings on how to install OramaCore" },
                
            ],
            "aborted": false,
            "error": false,
            "errorMessage": null
        }
    ]
    ```

5. Fifth state change: Orama generates the second response token:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7",
            "query": "How do I install OramaCore?",
            "response": "You can install Orama", // <---- This is the second response token
            "sources": [
                { "id": "123", "score": 0.8, "document": { ... } },
                { "id": "456", "score": 0.6, "document": { ... } }
            ],
            "loading": true, // The loading flag will be true until the full response is generated
            "planned": true, // 'planned' is set to true since we're using getPlannedAnswer
            "plan": [
                { "step": "OPTIMIZE_QUERY", "description": "Write an optimized OramaCore query for the user input" },
                { "step": "PERFORM_ORAMA_SEARCH", "description": "Perform search using the optimized query generated in the previous step" },
                { "step": "GIVE_REPLY", "description": "Reply with your findings on how to install OramaCore" },
                
            ],
            "aborted": false,
            "error": false,
            "errorMessage": null
        }
    ]
    ```

OramaCore will continue to update the state and trigger the `onStateChange` event until the full response is generated, and the state will look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "bqrziu882rfx33n6cnk69ya7",
        "query": "How do I install OramaCore?",
        "response": "You can install Orama Core by pulling the oramasearch/oramacore:latest Docker image",
        "sources": [
            { "id": "123", "score": 0.8, "document": { ... } },
            { "id": "456", "score": 0.6, "document": { ... } }
        ],
        "loading": false,
        "planned": true,
        "plan": [
            { "step": "OPTIMIZE_QUERY", "description": "Write an optimized OramaCore query for the user input" },
            { "step": "PERFORM_ORAMA_SEARCH", "description": "Perform search using the optimized query generated in the previous step" },
            { "step": "GIVE_REPLY", "description": "Reply with your findings on how to install OramaCore" },
            
        ],
        "aborted": false,
        "error": false,
        "errorMessage": null
    }
]
```
