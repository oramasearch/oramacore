The threshold property is used to set the minimum/maximum number of results to return.

## The problem

Let's consider the following example:

```javascript
import { create, insert, search } from "@orama/orama";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    title: "string",
  },
});

insert(db, { title: "Blue t-shirt, slim fit" });
insert(db, { title: "Blue t-shirt, regular fit" });
insert(db, { title: "Red t-shirt, slim fit" });
insert(db, { title: "Red t-shirt, oversize fit" });
```

As you can see, we're inserting 4 documents with a lot of common keywords.

What happens if I search for `"t-shirt"`?

```javascript
const results = search(db, {
  term: "t-shirt",
});

// results.count = 4
```

In that case, every single document will be returned, as they all contain the `"t-shirt"` keyword.

Now, what happens if I search for `"regular fit"`?

```javascript
const results = search(db, {
  term: "regular fit",
});

// results.count = 4
```

What! Why do I get 4 results? I only have 1 document that contains the `"regular fit"` keyword!

Well, Orama will position the document containing the `"regular fit"` keyword at the top of the results, but it will also return the other 3 documents, as they also contain the `"fit"` keyword.

With very long search queries, this can lead to a lot of results, which depending on your index size, it might not be what you want.

Imagine you have a database with 1 million documents, and you want to search for `"red t-shirt with long sleeves and a motorbike printed on the front"`. That's a pretty broad search, right? Maybe it's the case to limit the results a bit.

## Using the `threshold` property

The `threshold` property solves this problem by limiting (or maximizing) the number of results to return when performing a search operation.
It must be a number between `0` and `1`, and it represents the percentage of results to return.

### Setting the threshold to `1` (default)

By default, Orama sets the threshold to `1`. This means that all the results will be returned.

```javascript
const results = search(db, {
  term: "slim fit",
});
```

This will return **all** the documents containing **either** the `"slim"` keyword **or** the `"fit"` keyword. In our case, considering the example above, **all** the documents will be returned.

### Setting the threshold to `0`

Considering the example above, it will work the following way:

```javascript
const results = search(db, {
  term: "slim fit",
  threshold: 0,
});
```

In this case, the `threshold` property is set to `0`, which means that only the document containing the `"slim fit"` keywords will be returned.
This applies to all the document properties; if a keyword is found in a property, and another keyword is found in a different property, the document will be returned.

You can boost the results depending on where a property is found using the [field boosting](/open-source/usage/search/fields-boosting) API.

### Setting the threshold to a value between `0` and `1`

```javascript
const results = search(db, {
  term: "slim fit",
  threshold: 0.6,
});
```

In this case, the `threshold` property is set to `0.6`, which means that only the document containing the `"slim fit"` keywords will be returned, plus 60% of the other documents containing either the `"slim"` keyword or the `"fit"` keyword.
