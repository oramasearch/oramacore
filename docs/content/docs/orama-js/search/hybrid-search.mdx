Hybrid search is an Orama feature that allows you to perform full-text and vector search in one unique query, combining the results to get the best of both worlds.

<Callout title="Generating Embeddings">
In this page, we will assume that you already have the embeddings for your documents.

If you don't, you can use the [Plugin Embeddings](/open-source/plugins/plugin-embeddings) to generate them directly offline and on-device at insert and search time.

If you're running Orama in a memory-constrained environment, you can also use the [Plugin Secure Proxy](/open-source/plugins/plugin-secure-proxy) to generate embeddings on the fly using the OpenAI API directly from the client-side.

## Performing Hybrid Search

To perform hybrid search, you will need to use the same `search` method you're already using for full-text and vector search, which can be imported from `@orama/orama`:

```js copy
import { search } from "@orama/orama";
```

The key differences between running hybrid search and full-text search are:

1. Instead of searching for a `term` exclusively, you will also need to provide a `vector` object to search.
2. You will need to set `mode` to `"hybrid"` when running search.
3. You will need to specify the vector property you want to search on.
4. At the time of writing, you can only search through one vector property at a time. If you think that this is too limiting, please open a [feature request](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) to support multiple vector properties at search-time.

Let's see a full example of how to perform vector search:

```js copy
import { create, insertMultiple, search } from '@orama/orama'

const db = create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',        // To make it simple, let's pretend that
    embedding: 'vector[5]', // we are using a 5-dimensional vector.
  }
})

insertMultiple(db, [
  { title: 'The Prestige', embedding: [0.938293, 0.284951, 0.348264, 0.948276, 0.564720] },
  { title: 'Barbie',       embedding: [0.192839, 0.028471, 0.284738, 0.937463, 0.092827] },
  { title: 'Oppenheimer',  embedding: [0.827391, 0.927381, 0.001982, 0.983821, 0.294841] },
])

const results = search(db, {
  mode: 'hybrid',
  term: 'The Prestige'
  vector: {
    value: [0.938292, 0.284961, 0.248264, 0.748276, 0.264720],
    property: 'embedding',
  },
  similarity: 0.85,      // Minimum vector search similarity. Defaults to `0.8`
  includeVectors: true,  // Defaults to `false`
  limit: 10,             // Defaults to `10`
  offset: 0,             // Defaults to `0`
})
```

<Callout title="Simplify it!">
When running vector search using the [secure proxy](/open-source/plugins/plugin-embeddings) or [embeddings](/open-source/plugins/plugin-secure-proxy) plugins, you won't need to explicitly pass the `vector` configuration. Just run a simple search query!

```js
const results = search(db, {
  mode: "vector",
  term: "Videogame for little kids with a passion about ice cream",
});
```

The plugin will automatically convert this text to vector for you, and will also prevent you from exposing your OpenAI API key when using it on the front-end.
</Callout>

The returning object will be exactly the same as the one we would expect when performing full-text search:

```js
{
  count: 1,
  elapsed: {
    raw: 25000,
    formatted: '25ms',
  },
  hits: [
    {
      id: '1-19238',
      score: 0.812383129,
      document: {
        title: 'The Prestige',
        embedding: [0.938293, 0.284951, 0.348264, 0.948276, 0.564720],
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Since vectors can be quite large, you can also choose to not include them in the response by setting `includeVectors` to `false` (default behavior).

## Custom hybrid weights

By default, Orama performs full-text and vector searches concurrently. Then, it aggregates the results and uses default weights to determine which result is more important (the full-text or the vector one) in the final list of results.

You can customize these weights by passing a `hybridWeights` property to the search function:

```js
const results = search(db, {
  mode: "hybrid",
  term: "The Prestige",
  vector: {
    value: [0.912729, 0.49271, 0.291728, 0.93819, 0.53618],
    property: "embedding",
  },
  hybridWeights: {
    text: 0.8,
    vector: 0.2,
  },
});
```

By default, Orama assigns `0.5` to `text` and `0.5` to `vector`. This means that full-text results and vector results carry the same weight.

However, in the example above, we adjust these weights to `{ text: 0.8, vector: 0.2 }`. This implies that full-text search results will hold more relevance than vector search results in the final list.
