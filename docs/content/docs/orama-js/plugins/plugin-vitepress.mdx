Vitepress is a Vite & Vue powered static site generator.

## Installation

You can install the plugin using any major Node.js package manager.

```bash
npm install @orama/plugin-vitepress
```

## Usage

This plugin will look for all the `.md` files in your documentation directory and will automatically index them for you.

After the installation via the package manager of your choice, you can import the plugin in your `.vitepress/config.js` file:

```js
import { OramaPlugin } from "@orama/plugin-vitepress";

export default {
  // ...
  extends: {
    vite: {
      plugins: [OramaPlugin()],
    },
  },
};
```

And that's it! The Orama plugin will do the rest for you.
