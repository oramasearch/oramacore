<Callout title='What are stopwords?'>
The words which are generally filtered out before processing a natural language are called **stop words**. These are
actually the most common words in any language (like articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc) and does not
add much information to the text. Examples of a few stop words in English are “the”, “a”, “an”, “so”, “what”.

<Callout type="warn">
Note that as of Orama 1.0.7, stop-words are shipped via a separate `@orama/stopwords` package.
</Callout>
Orama provides support for stop-words removal via the `@orama/stopwords` package.

```bash
npm install @orama/stopwords
```

## Enabling stop-words removal

By default, Orama does not remove any stop-word, as this is intended to be an explicit action from the user. To enable stop-words removal, you can use the `stopWords` property when creating a new Orama instance:

```javascript copy
import { create } from "@orama/orama";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
  components: {
    tokenizer: {
      stopWords: ["foo", "bar"], // Enable custom stop-words
    },
  },
});
```

## Using the default stop-words list

By installing the `@orama/stopwords` package, you can use the default stop-words list for a given language:

```javascript copy
import { create } from "@orama/orama";
import { stopwords as englishStopwords } from "@orama/stopwords/english";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
  components: {
    tokenizer: {
      stopWords: englishStopwords,
    },
  },
});
```

Using the default stop-words list is the recommended way to enable stop-words removal, as it is the most efficient way to do so.

## Extending the default stop-words list

You can always extend the default stop-words list by adding or removing words:

```javascript copy
import { create } from "@orama/orama";
import { stopwords as italianStopwords } from "@orama/stopwords/italian";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
  components: {
    tokenizer: {
      stopWords: [...italianStopwords, "ciao", "buongiorno"],
    },
  },
});
```
