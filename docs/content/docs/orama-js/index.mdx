Orama is an <a href="https://github.com/oramasearch/orama" target="_blank">open source</a>, high performance full-text and vector search engine entirely written in TypeScript, with zero dependencies. 

## Requirements

A JavaScript runtime is the **only** requirement. Orama has been designed to work on any JS runtime and has no dependencies.

## Installation

You can install Orama using any JavaScript packahe manager of your choice.

```bash
npm install orama
```

Or import it directly in a browser module:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import {
        create,
        search,
        insert,
      } from "https://unpkg.com/@orama/orama@latest/dist/index.js";

      // ...
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Basic usage

```ts copy
import { create, search, insert } from "@orama/orama";

// Create a new Orama instance
const db = create({
  schema: {
    name: "string",
    description: "string",
    price: "number",
    meta: {
      rating: "number",
    },
  },
});

// Insert documents into the database
insert(db, {
  name: "Wireless Headphones",
  description: "Experience immersive sound quality with these noise-cancelling wireless headphones.",
  price: 99.99,
  meta: {
    rating: 4.5,
  },
});

// Search for documents
const searchResult = search(db, {
  term: "headphones",
});

console.log(searchResult.hits.map((hit) => hit.document));
```

## CommonJS Imports

Orama ships **ESM** modules by default. This allows us to move faster when providing new features and bug fixes, as well as using the `"exports"` field in `package.json` to provide a better developer experience.

CommonJS imports are still supported, but we suggest you to migrate to ESM.

## TypeScript

Set `moduleResolution` in the `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` to be either `Node16` or `NodeNext`.

When importing types, always refer to the standard orama import:

```ts copy
import type { Language } from "@orama/orama";
```
