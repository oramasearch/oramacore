Right now, Orama supports 30 languages out of the box in 8 different alphabets. \
For every language, Orama provides a default tokenizer, stop-words, and stemmer.

<Callout title='🇨🇳🇯🇵 A note on Chinese and Japanese'>
At the time of writing, Chinese (Mandarin) and Japanese are the only exception, since Orama provides everything by default but the stemmer.

Since Chinese and Japanese logograms follow different rules than other alphabets, you will need to import a dedicated tokenizer for it.
