title: Insert Data
description: Insert data into an Orama database.
---

Whenever we create a database with Orama, we must specify a `schema`, which
represents the entry we are going to index.

Let's say our database and schema look like this:

```javascript copy
import { create, insert } from "@orama/orama";

const movieDB = create({
  schema: {
    title: "string",
    director: "string",
    plot: "string",
    year: "number",
    isFavorite: "boolean",
  },
});
```

(Read more about database creation on the [create](/docs/orama-js/usage/create) page)

## Insert

Data insertion in Orama is quick and intuitive:

```javascript copy
const thePrestigeId = insert(movieDB, {
  title: "The prestige",
  director: "Christopher Nolan",
  plot: "Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.",
  year: 2006,
  isFavorite: true,
});

const bigFishId = insert(movieDB, {
  title: "Big Fish",
  director: "Tim Burton",
  plot: "Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.",
  year: 2004,
  isFavorite: true,
});

const harryPotterId = insert(movieDB, {
  title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
  director: "Chris Columbus",
  plot: "Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.",
  year: 2001,
  isFavorite: false,
});
```

If you have a lot of records, we suggest using the `insertMultiple` function as following:

```javascript copy
const docs = [
  {
    title: "The prestige",
    director: "Christopher Nolan",
    plot: "Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.",
    year: 2006,
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: "Big Fish",
    director: "Tim Burton",
    plot: "Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.",
    year: 2004,
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
    director: "Chris Columbus",
    plot: "Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.",
    year: 2001,
    isFavorite: false,
  },
];

insertMultiple(movieDB, docs);
```

Inserting a large number of documents in a loop could potentially block the event loop.
Instead `insertMultiple` handles this case better.

You can pass a third, optional, parameter to change the batch size (default:
`1000`). We recommend keeping this number as low as possible to avoid blocking
the event loop. The `batchSize` refers to the maximum number of `insert`
operations to perform before yielding the event loop.

```javascript
insertMultiple(movieDB, docs, 500);
```

## Validation rules

Defining the schema at database creation time, Orama validates all the inserted documents following those rules:

- throw an error if a field has an unexpected type
- allow missing fields or fields set to `undefined`
- allow extra fields ignoring them

So the following document will be accepted:

```javascript copy
import { create, insert } from "@orama/orama";

const movieDB = create({
  schema: {
    title: "string",
    year: "number",
  },
});

insert(movieDB, {
  title: "The prestige",
  // `year` field is missing but it's ok
  // year: 2006,
  // Extra fields `director` and `isFavorite` will not be indexed
  director: "Christopher Nolan",
  isFavorite: true,
});
```

## Custom document IDs

<Callout>
If the `id` field is not found, Orama will generate a random `id` for the document.
To provide a custom ID for a document, see the [components](/usage/orama-js/internals/components) page.
</Callout>

Orama automatically uses the `id` field of the document, if found.

That means that given the following document and schema:

```js
import { create, search } from "@orama/orama";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    id: "string",
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
});

insert(db, {
  id: "73cbcc79-2203-49b8-bb52-60d8e9a66c5f",
  author: "Fernando Pessoa",
  quote: "I wasn't meant for reality, but life came and found me",
});
```

the document will be indexed with the following `id`: `73cbcc79-2203-49b8-bb52-60d8e9a66c5f`.

<Callout type="warn">
**Beware** <br />
If you try to insert two documents with the same ID, Orama will throw an error.
</Callout>

## Remote document storing

By default Orama keeps a copy of the inserted document in memory (and in the serialized data) to speed up search performance.

If this is not acceptable, you can provide a custom `documentsStore` component which will be responsible to store
and fetch documents from another location (local or remote).

The code example below is an example that implements a proxy: when a document is requested, the code finds it on a location of the filesystem.
We assume each document has an `id` field which disable Orama random ID generation.

You can replace the file related operations with your custom code.

```javascript copy
import { readFile, readdir, writeFile, rm } from "node:fs/promises";
import { resolve } from "node:path";
import { create } from "@orama/orama";

const ROOT_LOCATION = "/var/db/orama-example";

async function getDocument(id) {
  return JSON.parse(
    await readFile(resolve(ROOT_LOCATION, `${id}.json`), "utf-8")
  );
}

async function listDocuments() {
  const allFiles = await readdir(ROOT_LOCATION);

  return allFiles.filter((id) => id.endsWith(".json"));
}

const database = create({
  schema: {
    title: "string",
    director: "string",
  },
  components: {
    // override partially the default documents store
    documentsStore: {
      create() {
        return {};
      },
      load(raw) {
        return {};
      },
      save(store) {
        return {};
      },
      get(_, id) {
        return getDocument(id);
      },
      getMultiple(_, ids) {
        return Promise.all(
          ids.map(async (id) => {
            return JSON.parse(await getDocument(id));
          })
        );
      },
      async getAll() {
        const docs = await listDocuments();

        return Promise.all(
          docs.map(async (id) => {
            return JSON.parse(await getDocument(id));
          })
        );
      },
      store() {
        // No-op
      },
      remove() {
        // No-op
      },
      async count() {
        const docs = await listDocuments();

        return docs.count;
      },
    },
  },
});
```
