Removal is one of the easiest things to do in Orama. Let's say we have the
following database with the following inserted documents:

```javascript copy
import { create, insert, remove, search } from "@orama/orama";

const movieDB = create({
  schema: {
    title: "string",
    director: "string",
    plot: "string",
    year: "number",
    isFavorite: "boolean",
  },
});

const thePrestigeId = insert(movieDB, {
  title: "The prestige",
  director: "Christopher Nolan",
  plot: "Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.",
  year: 2006,
  isFavorite: true,
});

const bigFishId = insert(movieDB, {
  title: "Big Fish",
  director: "Tim Burton",
  plot: "Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.",
  year: 2004,
  isFavorite: true,
});

const harryPotterId = insert(movieDB, {
  title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
  director: "Chris Columbus",
  plot: "Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.",
  year: 2001,
  isFavorite: false,
});
```

To remove a single document from the database we use the:

```javascript copy
remove(movieDB, harryPotterId);
```

As simple as that.

## Batch removal

Most of the `remove` function internals are synchronous, so removing a large
number of documents in a loop could potentially block the event loop. If you
have a lot of records, we suggest using the `removeMultiple` function.

You can pass a third, optional, parameter to change the batch size (default:
`1000`). We recommend keeping this number as low as possible to avoid blocking
the event loop. The `batchSize` refers to the maximum number of `remove`
operations to perform before yielding the event loop.

```javascript copy
const docs = [
  {
    title: "The prestige",
    director: "Christopher Nolan",
    plot: "Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.",
    year: 2006,
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: "Big Fish",
    director: "Tim Burton",
    plot: "Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.",
    year: 2004,
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
    director: "Chris Columbus",
    plot: "Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.",
    year: 2001,
    isFavorite: false,
  },
];

const ids = insertMultiple(movieDB, docs, 500);
removeMultiple(movieDB, ids, 500);
```

The function returns the number of the removed documents.
