When using AI to generate answers via an [answer session](/docs/apis/answer-session), you can manage your audience by defining a set of rules to segment your users and target specific groups with slightly different answers, allowing you to personalize the user experience and drive engagement and conversion.

OramaCore uses two main concepts to manage your audience:

- **Segments**: A segment is a group of users that share a common set of characteristics.
- **Triggers**: A trigger is a rule that defines how to respond to a user based on their interaction with your application.

With OramaCore, we aim to give you full control over your audience management by using just natural language.

In the next sections, we will see how to create segments, triggers, and how to use them in an answer session.
