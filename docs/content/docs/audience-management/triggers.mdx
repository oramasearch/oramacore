In OramaCore, triggers are a set of rules that define how to respond to a user based on their interaction with your application. They are an essential part of audience management, allowing you to personalize the user experience and drive engagement and conversion.

## Example: Luxury Car Dealership

In the past section ([on user segmentation](/docs/audience-management/segments)), we discussed how we could segment users of a luxury car dealership into three groups:

- Exotic Car Lovers
- Luxury Car Explorers
- Luxury Car Buyers

Now, let's see how we can use triggers to provide them with the best answers based on their needs and interests.
