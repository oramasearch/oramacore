In OramaCore, triggers are a set of rules that define how to respond to a user based on their interaction with your application. They are an essential part of audience management, allowing you to personalize the user experience and drive engagement and conversion.

## Example: Luxury Car Dealership

![Luxury Car Dealership](/docs/triggers/ferrari.jpg)

In the past section ([on user segmentation](/docs/audience-management/segments)), we discussed how we could segment users of a luxury car dealership into three groups:

- Exotic Car Lovers
- Luxury Car Explorers
- Luxury Car Buyers

Once you segmented your users, you can decide to reply differently to each group, even if they all ask the same thing. Let's see an example:

| Question | Segment | Reply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "What's the price of the new Ferrari?" | Exotic Car Lovers | "The new Ferrari is $300,000. Configure yours and share it on your Instagram!" |
| "How much does the new Ferrari cost?" | Luxury Car Explorers | "The new Ferrari is $100,000. Book a test drive and get a free gift!" |
| "New Ferrari cost" | Luxury Car Buyers | "The new Ferrari is $300,000. Buy today to get an exclusive membership to our club!" |

The reasoning behind these three different replies based on the same question is that each segment has different needs and expectations.

As we've seen when discussing segments, **Exotic Car Lovers** may not necessarily have the budget to buy a Ferrari, but they are interested in the brand and the lifestyle associated with it. Therefore, prompting them to configure their own Ferrari and share it on Instagram is a way to engage them and keep them interested in the brand.

**Luxury Car Explorers** are interested in the car but may not be ready to buy yet. It may be convenient to offer them a test drive and a free gift to incentivize them to visit the dealership and experience the car in person.

Finally, **Luxury Car Buyers** are ready to buy and need a little push to make the purchase.

You can apply this logic to any domain and any type of user interaction. Triggers are a powerful tool to personalize the user experience and drive engagement and conversion.

## Creating a Trigger

To create a treigger, you can either use the official SDKs or an API call.

Every trigger is composed of the following fields:

| Field       | Description                                                                 | Mandatory |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `name`      | The name of the trigger.                                                    | Yes       |
| `description` | A natural language description of the trigger. It describes the situation in which the trigger should be activated. | Yes       |
| `response` | A natural language description of how OramaCore should respond to the trigger. | Yes        |
| `segment_id` | The ID of the segment to which the trigger is associated. | No        |

While you can create triggers without passing a `segment_id`, we highly recommend you to associate each trigger with a segment. This way, you can provide different responses to different segments, personalizing the user experience and driving engagement and conversion.

<Tabs groupId='insert' persist items={['cURL', 'JavaScript']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/triggers/insert \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <write_api_key>' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Ferrari Price",
    "description": "User asks for the price of a luxury car.",
    "response": "Give the price of the car, then prompt the user to configure it and share it on social media.",
    "segment_id": "<SEGMENT_ID>"
  }'
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>'
  writeAPIKey: '<write_api_key>',
})

await collection.insertTrigger({
    name: 'Ferrari Price',
    description: 'User asks for the price of a luxury car.',
    response: 'Give the price of the car, then prompt the user to configure it and share it on social media.',
    segmentID: '<SEGMENT_ID>'
})
```
</Tabs>

## Getting a Trigger

After inserting a trigger, you'll receive its ID in the response. You can use this ID to retrieve the trigger details.

<Tabs groupId='get' persist items={['cURL', 'JavaScript']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/triggers/get?id=<SEGMENT_ID>&api-key=<READ_API_KEY>
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>'
  readAPIKey: '<read_api_key>',
})

await collection.getTrigger("<SEGMENT_ID>")
```
</Tabs>

## Listing all triggers

When inserting one or more triggers, you can list all of them to get an overview of your audience.

<Tabs groupId='getall' persist items={['cURL', 'JavaScript']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/triggers/all?api-key=<READ_API_KEY>
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>'
  readAPIKey: '<read_api_key>',
})

await collection.getAllTriggers()
```
</Tabs>

## Update a Trigger

<Callout type='warn'>
**Beware**: You can not change the `segment_id` of a trigger once it has been created. If you need to change the segment, you should delete the trigger and create a new one.
</Callout>

To update a trigger, you can use the following API call:

<Tabs groupId='insert' persist items={['cURL', 'JavaScript']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/triggers/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <write_api_key>' \
  -d '{
    "id": "<TRIGGER_ID>",
    "name": "Ferrari Price",
    "description": "User asks for the price of a luxury car.",
    "response": "Give the price of the car, then prompt the user to configure it and share it on social media."
    "segment_id": "<SEGMENT_ID>"
  }'
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>'
  writeAPIKey: '<write_api_key>',
})

await collection.updateTrigger({
    id: '<TRIGGER_ID>',
    name: 'Ferrari Price',
    description: 'User asks for the price of a luxury car.',
    response: 'Give the price of the car, then prompt the user to configure it and share it on social media.',
    segmentID: '<SEGMENT_ID>'
})
```
</Tabs>

## Delete a Trigger

You can always delete a trigger if you don't need it anymore. The trigger will be removed from the collection, and you won't be able to retrieve it anymore.

<Tabs groupId='insert' persist items={['cURL', 'JavaScript']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/triggers/delete \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <write_api_key>' \
  -d '{ "id": "<TRIGGER_ID>" }'
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>'
  writeAPIKey: '<write_api_key>',
})

await collection.deleteTrigger({
    id: '<TRIGGER_ID>'
})
```
