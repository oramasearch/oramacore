Building search engines, copilots, answer systems, or pretty much any AI project is harder than it should be.

Even in the simplest cases, you'll need a vector database, a connection to an LLM for generating embeddings, a solid chunking mechanism, and another LLM to generate answers. And that's without even considering your specific needs, where all these pieces need to work together in a way that's unique to your use case.

OramaCore simplifies the chaos of setting up and maintaining a complex architecture. It gives you a single, easy-to-use, opinionated server that's designed to help you create tailored solutions for your own unique challenges.

## Why OramaCore

OramaCore gives you everything you need **in a single Dockerfile**.

Just pull it from DockerHub:

```sh
docker pull oramasearch/oramacore:latest
```

You're getting acces to:

<Cards>
    <Card icon={<SearchIcon className="dark:text-purple-300 text-purple-500" />} title='Search engine'>
        A powerful, low-latency search engine with built-in support for >30 languages.
    </Card>

    <Card icon={<DatabaseIcon className="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-500" />} title='Vector database'>
        A complete vector database with automatic chunking and automatic embeddings generation.
    </Card>

    <Card icon={<WholeWordIcon className="dark:text-green-300 text-green-500" />} title='Small, fine tuned language models'>
        An array of small, fine-tuned language models that can handle all sorts of operations on your data, from translating natural language queries into optimized OramaCore queries to running custom agents.
    </Card>

    <Card icon={<FileJson className="dark:text-yellow-300 text-yellow-500" />} title='A JavaScript runtime'>
        A fast, integrated, fully functional JavaScript runtime (powered by [Deno](https://deno.com)) so you can write custom agents and business logic in plain JavaScript.
    </Card>
</Cards>

All from a single, self-contained image.

## On being opinionated

When building OramaCore, we made a deliberate choice to create an opinionated system. We offer strong, general-purpose default configurations while still giving you the flexibility to customize them as needed.

There are plenty of great vector databases and full-text search engines out there. But most of them don't work seamlessly together out of the box—they often require extensive fine-tuning to arrive at a functional solution.

Our goal is to provide you with a platform that's ready to go the moment you pull a single Docker file.
