<Callout type='warn'>
OramaCore is currently under active development. Our goal is to release the first Beta version (**v0.1.0**) on **Jan 31st, 2025**, and the first stable version (**v1.0.0**) on **Feb 28th, 2025**.

While the system is already quite stable, please note that APIs will undergo changes in **v0.1.0** and **v1.0.0**.

## Configuring OramaCore

OramaCore uses a straightforward `config.yaml` file for configuration and customization.

While we provide robust defaults for nearly every option in the configuration file — making it almost unnecessary to write one yourself — here is an example of a typical `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
http:
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8080
    allow_cors: true
    with_prometheus: true

writer_side:
    output: in-memory
    # Replace the following value with your own API key
    master_api_key: foobar
    config:
        data_dir: ./.data/writer
        # The maximum number of embeddings that can be stored in the queue
        # before the writer starts to be blocked
        # NB: the elements are in memory, so be careful with this value
        embedding_queue_limit: 50000
        # The number of the document insertions after the write side will commit the changes
        insert_batch_commit_size: 50000
        # The default embedding model used to calculate the embeddings
        # if not specified in the collection creation
        default_embedding_model: MultilingualE5Small

reader_side:
    input: in-memory
    config:
        data_dir: ./.data/reader
        # The number of the write operation after the read side will commit the changes
        insert_batch_commit_size: 50000

ai_server:
    scheme: http
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 50051
    api_key: ""
    max_connections: 15
    total_threads: 12

    embeddings:
        default_model_group: multilingual
        dynamically_load_models: false
        execution_providers:
            - CUDAExecutionProvider
            - CPUExecutionProvider
        total_threads: 8
```

All the options above are optional, and you can customize them as needed.

Let's break them down one section at a time.

## `http`

The `http` section configures the HTTP server that serves the OramaCore API. Here are the available options:

- `host`: The host where the HTTP server will listen. By default, it listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
- `port`: The port where the HTTP server will listen. By default, it listens on port `8080`.
- `allow_cors`: Whether to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests. By default, it's set to `true`. We recommend keeping it enabled.
- `with_prometheus`: Whether to expose Prometheus metrics. By default, it's set to `true`.

## `writer_side`

The `writer_side` section configures the writer side of OramaCore. Here are the available options:

- `output`: The output where the writer side will store the data. By default, it's set to `in-memory`.
- `master_api_key`: The master API key used to authenticate the requests to the writer side. By default, it's set to an empty string. See more about the available API keys in the [API Keys](/docs/guide/api-key) section.
- `config`: The configuration options for the writer side. Here are the available options:
  - `data_dir`: The directory where the writer side will persist the data on disk. By default, it's set to `./.data/writer`.
  - `embedding_queue_limit`: The maximum number of embeddings that can be stored in the queue before the writer starts to be blocked. By default, it's set to `50000`.
  - `insert_batch_commit_size`: The number of document insertions after which the write side will commit the changes. By default, it's set to `5000`.
  - `default_embedding_model`: The default embedding model used to calculate the embeddings if not specified in the collection creation. By default, it's set to `MultilingualE5Small`. See more about the available models in the [Embedding Models](/docs/customizations/text-embeddings) section.

## `reader_side`

The `reader_side` section configures the reader side of OramaCore. Here are the available options:

- `input`: The input where the reader side will store the data. By default, it's set to `in-memory`.
- `config`: The configuration options for the reader side. Here are the available options:
  - `data_dir`: The directory where the reader side will persist the data on disk. By default, it's set to `./.data/reader`.
  - `insert_batch_commit_size`: The number of write operations after which the read side will commit the changes. By default, it's set to `50000`.

## `ai_server`

The `ai_server` section configures the Python gRPC server that is responsible for calculating the embeddings and managing LLMs. Here are the available options:

- `scheme`: The scheme where the AI server will listen. By default, it's set to `http`.
- `host`: The host where the AI server will listen. By default, it listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
- `port`: The port where the AI server will listen. By default, it listens on port `50051`.
- `api_key`: The API key used to authenticate the requests to the AI server. By default, it's set to an empty string - no authentication is required since it's not recommended to expose the AI server to the public internet.
- `max_connections`: The maximum number of connections that the AI server will accept. By default, it's set to `15`.
- `total_threads`: The total number of threads that the AI server will use. By default, it's set to `12`.

The `embeddings` section configures the embeddings calculation. Here are the available options:

- `default_model_group`: The default model group used to calculate the embeddings if not specified in the collection creation. By default, it's set to `multilingual`. See more about the available models in the [Embedding Models](/docs/customizations/text-embeddings) section.
- `dynamically_load_models`: Whether to dynamically load the models. By default, it's set to `false`.
- `execution_providers`: The execution providers used to calculate the embeddings. By default, it's set to `CUDAExecutionProvider` and `CPUExecutionProvider`.
- `total_threads`: The total number of threads used to calculate the embeddings. By default, it's set to `8`.
