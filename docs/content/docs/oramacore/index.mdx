Building AI projects like search engines or copilots **is harder than it should be**, requiring vector databases, LLMs, chunking, and seamless integration while handling network slowdowns and performance issues. OramaCore simplifies this with a unified, opinionated server for easier development and customization.

## Quick Start

OramaCore gives you everything you need **in a single Dockerfile**.

Just pull it from DockerHub:

```sh
docker pull oramasearch/oramacore:latest
```

You're getting acces to:

<Cards>
    <Card icon={<SearchIcon className="dark:text-purple-300 text-purple-500" />} title='Search engine'>
        A powerful, low-latency search engine with built-in support for >30 languages.
    </Card>

    <Card icon={<DatabaseIcon className="dark:text-blue-300 text-blue-500" />} title='Vector database'>
        A complete vector database with automatic chunking and automatic embeddings generation.
    </Card>

    <Card icon={<WholeWordIcon className="dark:text-green-300 text-green-500" />} title='LLMs'>
        Built-in support for both local and remote large language models that can handle all sorts of operations on your data, from translating natural language queries into optimized OramaCore queries to running custom agents.
    </Card>

    <Card icon={<FileJson className="dark:text-yellow-300 text-yellow-500" />} title='A JavaScript runtime'>
        A fast, integrated, fully functional JavaScript runtime (powered by [Deno](https://deno.com)) so you can write custom agents and business logic in plain JavaScript.
    </Card>
</Cards>

All in a single Docker Compose file.

### Configuration

To get started with OramaCore, you can use the default configuration. But if you want to customize it, you can do so by editing the `config.yml` file.
You can customize the system to fit your specific needs. Check out the [configuration](/docs/guide/configuration) guide to learn more.

## Why OramaCore?

Building search engines, copilots, answer systems, or pretty much any AI project is pretty challenging.
Even in the simplest cases, you'll need a vector database, a connection to an LLM for generating embeddings, a solid chunking mechanism, and another LLM to generate answers.
And that's without even considering your specific needs, where all these pieces need to work together in a way that's unique to your use case.

On top of that, you're likely forced to add multiple layers of network-based communication, deal with third-party slowdowns beyond your control, and address all the typical challenges we consider when building high-performance, high-quality applications.

OramaCore simplifies the chaos of setting up and maintaining a complex architecture. It gives you a single, easy-to-use, opinionated server that's designed to help you create tailored solutions for your own unique challenges.

### Philosophy

When building OramaCore, we made a deliberate choice to create **an opinionated system**. We offer strong, general-purpose default configurations while still giving you the flexibility to customize them as needed.

There are plenty of great vector databases and full-text search engines out there. But most of them don't work seamlessly together out of the boxâ€”they often require extensive fine-tuning to arrive at a functional solution.

Our goal is to provide you with a platform that's ready to go the moment you pull a single Docker file.

### OramaCore APIs

The one imperative we have when designing the OramaCore APIs is to make them as simple as possible. We want to make it easy for developers to get started with OramaCore, and to make it easy for them to build applications that use OramaCore.

Any additional steps, any additional complexity, any additional boilerplate, is a failure on our part. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to use OramaCore.

If you think we should improve on this front, please let us know at [info@orama.com](mailto:info@orama.com). We are always looking for feedback.
