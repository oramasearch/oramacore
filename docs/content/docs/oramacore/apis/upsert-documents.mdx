## APIs

<Callout type='warn'>
OramaCore updates are actually **upserts**. This means that if a document with the same ID already exists, it will be updated. Otherwise, a new document will be created.
</Callout>

<Callout>
API Key type: **`write_api_key`**. Do not expose it to the public.
</Callout>

Once you have a collection with at least one index and some documents in it, you can start updating documents using the following API:

<Tabs groupId='insert' persist items={['cURL', 'JavaScript']}>
```bash tab="cURL"
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/collections/{COLLECTION_ID}/indexes/{INDEX_ID}/insert \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <write_api_key>' \
  -d '[{
    "id": "<DOCUMENT_ID>",
    "title": "My upserted document",
    "content": "This is the content of my first upserted document."
  }]'
```

```js tab="JavaScript"
import { CollectionManager } from '@orama/core'

const collection = new CollectionManager({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  collectionID: '<COLLECTION_ID>'
  writeAPIKey: '<WRITE_API_KEY>',
})

const index = collection.setIndex('<INDEX_ID>')

// You can upsert a single document
await index.insertDocuments({
  id: '<DOCUMENT_ID>',
  title: 'My first upserted document',
  content: 'This is the content of my first upserted document.'
})

// Or you can upsert multiple documents by passing an array of objects
await index.insertDocuments([
  {
    id: '<DOCUMENT_ID>',
    title: 'My first upserted document',
    content: 'This is the content of my first upserted document.'
  },
  {
    id: '<DOCUMENT_ID>',
    title: 'My second upserted document',
    content: 'This is the content of my second upserted document.'
  }
])
```
</Tabs>

Just like during insertion, at upsert-time OramaCore will [automatically generate generate text embeddings](/docs/customizations/text-embeddings) for the document in real-time, allowing you to perform full-text, hybrid, and vector search immediately.
