description: "An introduction to the OramaCore REST APIs and SDKs."
---

With OramaCore we aim to provide a set of APIs that are backward compatible - or at least, as similar as possible - to those exposed by [Orama Cloud](https://docs.orama.com/cloud/performing-search).

At the time of writing, with OramaCore being in beta, we are still working on the APIs and SDKs. We are also working on the documentation, so please bear with us.

## APIs & SDKs

We will provide both REST APIs and SDKs for OramaCore.

We will always recommend to use the SDKs, as they will provide a more idiomatic way to interact with OramaCore.

Also, they'll abstract away a lot of the complexity that comes with server-side events, retries, and other things that are not directly related to the business logic of your application.

However, we understand that sometimes you might want to use the REST APIs directly, and we will provide them for you.

## SDKs

At the time of writing, the official SDKs are not yet available. We are working on them, and we will release them as soon as possible.

We plan to provide SDKs for the following languages:

- JavaScript (âœ… Available)
- Python (ðŸš§ In progress)
- Swift (ðŸš§ In progress)
- Kotlin (ðŸš§ In progress)

### JavaScript SDK

<Callout type='warn'>
**Pay attention to your API keys!**

When using JavaScript on the browser, you're exposing your API keys.\
While the **read API key** is safe to expose, the **master** and **write API keys** are not.

The `OramaCoreManager` class is **not** safe to use on the browser, as it exposes your **master** API key.

We recommend using the `CollectionManager` class on the browser, as it can work by passing the **read** API key only to the constructor.
</Callout>

The JavaScript SDK will be available as an NPM package. You will be able to install it with:

```package-install
npm i @orama/core
```

Once installed, you can start using as a regular JavaScript or TypeScript module:

```javascript
import { CollectionManager, OramaCoreManager } from '@orama/core'
```

As you can see in the example above, the SDK will provide you with two main classes: `CollectionManager` and `OramaCoreManager`.

The `OramaCoreManager` class is used to manage your whole OramaCore database. It allows you to create, update, and delete collections, as well as manage your API keys.

The `CollectionManager` class is used to manage a single collection. It allows you to perform searches, add, update, and delete documents, as well as perform answer engine sessions.
